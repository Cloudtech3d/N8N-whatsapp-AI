- Automate repetitive tasks
- Build integrations with no-code or low-code effort
- Learn n8n by example through real-world use cases
- Save time connecting APIs like WhatsApp, Telegram, OpenAI, and more

2. Open [n8n](https://n8n.io/) locally or in the cloud
3. Go to the workflow editor → “Import” → Paste or upload any JSON file from `/workflows`
